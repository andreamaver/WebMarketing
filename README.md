<h2  align="center">Web marketing project</h2>

  

The project consists in applying a RFM model to understand which people, from a market's client base, are the most important for the business, the ones that spend the most and most frequently. A churn algorithm is applied to understand which clients are the most probable to leave the company, in order to provide them with some custom marketing campaigns. At last, a market basket analysis allows to understand which products are sold together more frequently, which can lead to the creation of specific strategies

The data was provided by the professor and we can't provide them here. The project was developed with the R programming language and the scripts can be found in the [R](https://github.com/andreamaver/WebMarketing/tree/main/R) folder.

You can check out the full presentation (available only in Italian) describing all the results of the analysis at: [RFM, Churn and Market basket analysis](https://github.com/andreamaver/WebMarketing/blob/main/Presentation.pdf "Presentation.pdf").
